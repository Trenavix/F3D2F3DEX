# F3D2F3DEX
This program is a WIP and lies as a resource for those looking to convert Fast3D games, such as SM64 (the only supported game as of now), to Fast3DEX.

Upcoming plans: 
-Update specific DL list (.txt script) to include every DL in Mario 64 outside of level scripts
-Merge two TRI1 opcodes into a single TRI2 opcode
-More potential optimisations such as merging two G_VTX buffer loads into one
